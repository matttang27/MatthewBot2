# **MatthewBot2** (name subject to change)

MatthewBot was a discord bot that was really just doing whatever I felt like - like ping a person everytime they type to make sure they study :)

Also, it got pretty messy (my index.js was +1000 lines long) and stopped working, so I have decided to create a new bot

MatthewBot2 will be a discord bot that connects people and servers from around the world through games üó∫Ô∏è

## Features

Right now, it's pretty barren with only one game (connect4), but in the future, aligning with my goal, I'd like to implement
- **Online matchmaking where you can chat with your opponent** and maybe make a new friend
- **Server vs Server battles where members vote on their server's move** (or a bunch of individual matches)

## Development

Progress is kinda slow even though I've been working on it a lot recently. I've been trying to code more "professionally", by making my code more organized and writing (some) documentation.
The main reason is the test suite, which I spent like 3 weeks figuring out a way to test the bot. Honestly, I think it's a pretty good solution (I am so proud of my waitForMessage function).

Also, I finally used a cloud service to host the bot üòé. MatthewBot was kept alive using a repl.it loophole, and I don't wanna talk about it

Thank you for reading, and you can view my slow progress in the [plan.md](./plan.md) file :D
